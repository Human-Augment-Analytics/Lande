# Five finch groups on one surface

Beausoleil et al. (2023) fitted one fitness surface to 3428 ground
finches at El Garrapatero on Santa Cruz: four species, with *Geospiza
fortis* split into its small and large beak morphs, five groups in all.
Fitness was apparent lifespan, the last year a bird was seen minus the
first, and the traits were beak length and depth in millimetres.
`finch_community` holds the data, with the year each bird was first
caught, built from their archive (<doi:10.5683/SP3/0YIWSE>). The 172
birds first caught in 2020, the last year of the archive, could not be
seen again and have a lifespan of 0; they are among the 3428, so they
stay in, except in the comparison with capture year below.

``` r

library(Lande)
finches <- finch_community
table(finches$species)
```

## One pooled surface, the groups marked

The traits stay in millimetres (the first two warnings below note this),
the fitness type is detected as a count so the surface takes a Poisson
family as in their model, cells farther than 0.15 of the axis range from
any bird are blanked as in their code, and the group is used only to
mark each group’s mean and the highest point of the surface within its
own range. A pooled surface like this can’t tell the beak apart from
other differences between the species.

``` r

surface <- correlated_fitness_surface(finches, "lifespan", c("beak_length", "beak_depth"),
                                      k = 27, too_far = 0.15, grid_n = 100,
                                      group = "species", group_effect = FALSE)
```

Group means lie 0.64 to 1.38 mm from the highest fitted lifespan in
their range, 0.90 mm on average, as in Beausoleil et al. For fortis
small, fortis large and scandens the distances match theirs within 0.03
mm. For fuliginosa ours is about a quarter of a millimetre shorter
because they placed every peak within a rectangle drawn by hand. Their
own model with the rule used here gives 1.42 mm. For magnirostris ours
is about a quarter of a millimetre longer, and their model with our rule
gives 0.88 mm, so there the fit differs. The flags say whether each high
point is a peak: four groups sit by a peak of their own, and for
magnirostris the surface keeps rising past its 53 birds towards the edge
of the data. Every maximum of the surface is listed in the result.

## Overdispersion and the peak comparisons

The lifespans are overdispersed and the Poisson fit warns. With a
dispersion over three, Poisson standard errors are too small.
`count_family = "quasipoisson"` estimates the dispersion and
[`peak_difference()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/peak_difference.md)
uses it in its standard errors. The smoothness is chosen again under the
new family, which moves the fitted lifespan by a median of 0.01 years
and by up to 41% of the Poisson value in places.

``` r

The valley in each comparison is the pass, the lowest point on the
highest route between two high points. Fortis small sits about 2.5
standard errors above its passes to fortis large and to scandens, and
the lower of each pair about 1.5. Those z values run high (see
[`?peak_difference`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/peak_difference.md)),
so no pair is clearly separated, and no high point is reliably higher
than another. The straight line from fortis large to scandens crosses a
low patch at about 13.6 by 11.6 mm. The route between them goes round
it, past fortis small, so measuring the valley on the line, as
`route = "line"` does, makes the two look far more separate than they
are. The fuliginosa high point is not an interior peak on this fit.

## Checks on the peaks

Lifespan depends on when a bird was first caught, and the groups were
caught at different times.

``` r

Birds first caught in 2003 had an apparent lifespan of 1.4 years on
average; those first caught in 2020 could not be seen again. Only 2% of
the fuliginosa were first caught before 2009, against 42% of the
magnirostris. On the birds first caught before 2020, models with the
beak alone, the capture year alone and both show how much each accounts
for:

``` r

d$first_year <- factor(d$first_year)
beak <- correlated_fitness_surface(d, "lifespan", c("beak_length", "beak_depth"),
                                   k = 27, too_far = 0.15, grid_n = 100, count_family = "quasipoisson")

On the same birds the year of first capture alone explains 16% of the
deviance, beak length and depth 5%, and the two together 18%. With the
year in the model, at the same high points the passes are shallow, with
no pair well above the valley between them. The peaks also depend on the
fit. With a smaller basis, or a negative binomial family, only scandens
keeps a peak of its own:

``` r

k20 <- correlated_fitness_surface(finches, "lifespan", c("beak_length", "beak_depth"),
                                  k = 20, too_far = 0.15, grid_n = 100, group = "species",
                                  group_effect = FALSE, count_family = "quasipoisson")

                                 group_effect = FALSE, count_family = "nb")
data.frame(group = quasi$groups$group, k27 = quasi$groups$peak_interior,
           k20 = k20$groups$peak_interior, nb = nb$groups$peak_interior)
```

## The same surface on standardised traits

The usual route in the package standardises the traits first. The peaks
come back in millimetres by undoing the scaling.

g <- surface_z$groups
sds <- sapply(finches[, c("beak_length", "beak_depth")], sd)
