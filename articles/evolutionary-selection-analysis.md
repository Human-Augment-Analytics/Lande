# Evolutionary Selection Analysis

## Evolutionary Selection Analysis Framework

### 1. Overview

This package measures natural selection on phenotypic traits the way
Lande & Arnold (1983) set out, and adds spline fitness functions,
fitness surfaces and adaptive landscapes on top of the same prepared
data. Svensson (2023) reviews the approach and the arguments about it;
Palacio et al. (2019) set out what an analysis should report, and
[`check_selection_assumptions()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/check_selection_assumptions.md)
runs the checks they ask for on the data and the models.

**Key capabilities:**

| Analysis Type | Description |
|----|----|
| Selection differentials ($`\mathbf{S}`$) | Total selection acting on traits |
| Linear selection gradients ($`\boldsymbol{\beta}`$) | Direct directional selection |
| Nonlinear selection gradients ($`\boldsymbol{\gamma}`$) | Stabilising/disruptive and correlational selection |
| Univariate correlated fitness functions | Flexible spline-based fitness functions at the individual level |
| Bivariate correlated fitness surfaces | Thin-plate spline (TPS) or GAM surfaces of individual fitness as a function of two traits |
| Adaptive landscapes | Mean fitness as a function of population mean phenotype (requires simulation) |
| Landscapes over time | One fitness function or surface per period, on trait axes shared by all periods |
| Canonical analysis | $`\boldsymbol{\gamma}`$ rotated to its canonical axes, and the curvature along each axis tested |
| Peak comparison | The difference in fitted fitness between two peaks, or between a peak and the valley between them, with its standard error |
| Uncertainty | Bootstrap intervals for the gradients; standard error lines or bands on GAM surfaces |
| Binary and count fitness | Logistic regression for survival; Poisson or negative binomial regression for offspring counts (p-values only; the gradients stay OLS) |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Mathematical Framework

#### 2.1 Relative Fitness

Individual fitness is converted to relative fitness to enable
comparisons across populations and generations:

``` math
w_i = \frac{W_i}{\bar{W}}
```

where $`W_i`$ is the absolute fitness of individual $`i`$ (an offspring
count, or survival coded 0/1), $`\bar{W} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n W_i`$
is the mean fitness of the population, and $`w_i`$ is the relative
fitness of individual $`i`$.

**Why relative fitness?** Selection operates on relative, not absolute,
differences in fitness. This standardisation ensures that selection
gradients are comparable across studies. Brodie and Janzen (1996) showed
that regressing absolute survival puts the gradients on the wrong scale,
which is why the package always relativises fitness before fitting.
**File:** `prepare_selection_data.R`

#### 2.2 Trait Standardisation

Traits are standardised to mean 0 and variance 1 before analysis:

``` math
z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x}
```

where $`x_i`$ is the original trait value, $`\bar{x}`$ and $`s_x`$ are
the sample mean and standard deviation, and $`z_i`$ is the standardised
value.

**Purpose:** Standardisation puts all traits on the same scale, allowing
direct comparison of selection gradients. A $`\beta = 0.5`$ means that a
one-standard-deviation increase in the trait increases relative fitness
by 0.5 units.

**Standardise within the group you analyse.** Traits and relative
fitness must be scaled within the population and time period in
question. With data from several years or sites, pass the column to
`group` and both steps are done separately within each level before the
data are stacked. This is the same as fitting a fixed effect for the
group in the regression, so the pooled gradients gain power from the
extra individuals without mixing the groups’ scales. It also means the
pooled model cannot test whether selection differs between groups (a
year by trait interaction); fit the groups separately with
`return_grouped = TRUE` for that.

**Do not standardise twice.** The gradients are the raw partial
regression coefficients from the models fitted to these standardised
traits. Do not wrap the traits in
[`scale()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/scale.html) inside a model formula,
and do not use a modelling option that standardises predictors; either
would scale the coefficients a second time. **File:**
`prepare_selection_data.R`

#### 2.3 Selection Differential

The selection differential ($`S`$) measures the total selection acting
on a trait, including both direct and indirect effects through
correlated traits:

``` math
S = \text{Cov}(z, w) = \mathbb{E}[(z - \bar{z})(w - \bar{w})]
```

For multiple traits, the vector of selection differentials is:

``` math
\mathbf{S} = \text{Cov}(\mathbf{z}, w) = \begin{bmatrix} \text{Cov}(z_1, w) \\ \text{Cov}(z_2, w) \\ \vdots \\ \text{Cov}(z_m, w) \end{bmatrix}
```

It is the change in the trait mean within a generation (Arnold & Wade,
1984).

**Interpretation:** $`S`$ represents the shift in trait mean after one
generation of selection. A positive $`S`$ indicates the trait mean
increases. **File:** `selection_differential.R`

#### 2.4 Linear Selection Gradients

Linear selection gradients ($`\boldsymbol{\beta}`$) measure the direct
directional selection on each trait, controlling for correlations with
other traits:

``` math
w = \alpha + \boldsymbol{\beta}^T \mathbf{z} + \varepsilon
```

In matrix form:

``` math
\boldsymbol{\beta} = \mathbf{P}^{-1} \mathbf{S}
```

where $`\mathbf{P}`$ is the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix.

For a model with two traits:

``` math
w = \alpha + \beta_1 z_1 + \beta_2 z_2 + \varepsilon
```

**Interpretation:** $`\beta_i`$ is the partial regression coefficient:
the change in relative fitness for a one-standard-deviation increase in
trait $`i`$, holding all other traits constant.

**Tests.** The gradients always come from this least-squares fit on
relative fitness. Its t-tests are only valid when the residuals are
roughly normal, which holds for continuous fitness but not for survival
or offspring counts. For binary fitness the p-values therefore come from
a logistic regression of the raw 0/1 outcome on the same terms, and for
counts from a Poisson regression of the raw counts, replaced by a
negative binomial one when the counts are overdispersed. The
coefficients reported are still the least-squares gradients in every
case. **File:** `analyze_linear_selection.R`

#### 2.5 Nonlinear Selection Gradients

Quadratic selection gradients ($`\boldsymbol{\gamma}`$) measure
nonlinear selection, including stabilising/disruptive selection
(diagonal elements) and correlational selection (off-diagonal elements):

``` math
w = \alpha + \boldsymbol{\beta}^T \mathbf{z} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{z}^T \boldsymbol{\gamma} \mathbf{z} + \varepsilon
```

For two traits, this expands to:

``` math
w = \alpha + \beta_1 z_1 + \beta_2 z_2 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma_{11} z_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma_{22} z_2^2 + \gamma_{12} z_1 z_2 + \varepsilon
```

**Important:** The $`\frac{1}{2}`$ factor in the quadratic terms follows
Lande & Arnold’s convention, making $`\gamma_{ii}`$ the second
derivative of the fitness surface. In practice, most implementations
(including this one) report $`2 \times`$ the quadratic coefficient from
regression, which equals $`\gamma_{ii}`$.

**Interpretation:**

| $`\gamma`$ value | Type | Interpretation |
|----|----|----|
| $`\gamma_{ii} < 0`$ | Stabilising selection | Intermediate trait values have highest fitness |
| $`\gamma_{ii} > 0`$ | Disruptive selection | Extreme trait values have highest fitness |
| $`\gamma_{ij} > 0`$ | Positive correlational | Selection favours positive correlation between traits |
| $`\gamma_{ij} < 0`$ | Negative correlational | Selection favours negative correlation between traits |

**Canonical axes:** with several traits the curvature is spread over the
$`\gamma_{ii}`$ and the $`\gamma_{ij}`$ together. Canonical analysis
(Phillips & Arnold, 1989; Blows & Brooks, 2003) rotates
$`\boldsymbol{\gamma}`$ to its eigenvectors, combinations of the traits
that each have a single curvature, the eigenvalue $`\lambda`$. See
[`canonical_analysis()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/canonical_analysis.md)
in section 5.17.

**File:** `analyze_nonlinear_selection.R`,
`analyze_disruptive_selection.R`

#### 2.6 Nonparametric Fitness Functions and Surfaces

Traditional quadratic models impose a fixed shape on the fitness
function. Nonparametric methods allow the data to reveal unexpected
patterns. These are still individual-level fitness functions; the
population-level adaptive landscape is a separate construction (section
2.7). Cubic splines for one trait and thin-plate splines for two follow
Schluter (1988) and Schluter and Nychka (1994); Brodie et al. (1995) is
the guide to reading the surfaces.

**Univariate spline model:**

``` math
w = \alpha + s(z) + \varepsilon
```

where $`s(z)`$ is a smooth function estimated from the data using
penalised regression splines.

**Multivariate thin-plate spline:**

``` math
w = \alpha + f(z_1, z_2) + \varepsilon
```

where $`f(z_1, z_2)`$ is a two-dimensional smooth surface showing how
individual fitness varies across trait combinations. The univariate
spline uses generalised cross-validation for its smoothing parameter
(Schluter 1988); the surface uses REML. The surface is drawn only where
there are data: grid points outside the convex hull of the observed
trait pairs are blank, and a distance rule can also blank cells far from
any individual, as Beausoleil et al. (2023) did for a community of
Darwin’s finches. With a grouping column such as species, each group’s
mean and the highest point of the surface within that group’s own range
are marked on the plot.

**GAM formulation:**
``` math
w \sim \text{family}(\eta), \quad
\eta = \alpha + s(z_1, z_2)
```

**File:** `correlated_fitness_surface.R`

#### 2.7 Adaptive Landscapes (Population Level)

Following Sewall Wright’s original concept, the adaptive landscape
describes mean fitness as a function of population mean phenotype:

``` math
\bar{W} = g(\bar{z}_1, \bar{z}_2)
```

where:

- $`\bar{W}`$ = mean fitness of the population  
- $`\bar{z}_1, \bar{z}_2`$ = population mean phenotypes

Unlike correlated fitness surfaces (which use individual data), adaptive
landscapes require simulation because they represent a theoretical
construct: the expected mean fitness for a population with a given mean
phenotype.

**Calculation procedure:**

For each candidate population mean $`\bar{\mathbf{z}}`$:

**1. Simulate individuals around the mean**

``` math
\mathbf{z}_{\text{ind}} \sim \mathrm{N}(\bar{\mathbf{z}}, \mathbf{P})
```

where $`\mathbf{P}`$ is the within-population phenotypic
variance–covariance matrix.

**2. Predict individual fitness**

``` math
w_{\text{ind}} = \hat{f}(\mathbf{z}_{\text{ind}})
```

**3. Compute mean fitness**

``` math
\bar{W}(\bar{\mathbf{z}}) =
\frac{1}{N_{\text{sim}}}
\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\text{sim}}} w_{\text{ind}, j}
```

The resulting surface:

``` math
\bar{W} = g(\bar{z}_1, \bar{z}_2)
```

is the **adaptive landscape**.

**Mathematical distinction**

| Surface | Level | Formula | Interpretation |
|----|----|----|----|
| Correlated Fitness | Individual | $`w = f(\mathbf{z})`$ | Selection acting on individuals now |
| Adaptive Landscape | Population | $`\bar{W} = g(\bar{\mathbf{z}})`$ | Where selection would move the population mean |

**File:** `adaptive_landscape.R`

The two surfaces are compared with
[`compare_fitness_surfaces_data()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/compare_fitness_surfaces_data.md)
(section 5.15): the correlated fitness surface describes the selection
acting on individuals now, and the adaptive landscape describes where
that selection would move a population’s mean. The same construction
works for a single trait, where the landscape is a curve of mean fitness
against the population mean, drawn alongside the fitness function it was
averaged from.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.8 Landscapes over Time

Selection is rarely constant. Beausoleil et al. (2019) fitted a separate
fitness function to each year of the finch data and found the shape
changing from year to year, with two peaks in some years and a slope in
others. The package does the same with
[`temporal_landscape()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/temporal_landscape.md):
the fitness function (one trait) or surface (two traits) and, if asked,
the adaptive landscape are fitted separately for each level of a time
column, on traits standardised once over all periods so that the periods
share one axis. The result is one row per period with the sample size,
mean fitness, the degrees of freedom of the smooth, the position of the
highest fitness and, for one trait, the number of interior peaks.
[`plot_temporal_landscape()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/plot_temporal_landscape.md)
draws the periods side by side or, for one trait, as a heat map of
fitness against trait and time.

**File:** `temporal_landscape.R`

#### 4.3 Example data and the app

Five datasets come with the package, each with a help page giving its
columns and source: `bumpus`, the house sparrows of Bumpus (1899);
`crescent_pond_pupfish` and `little_lake_pupfish`, the pupfish of Martin
(2016); `finch_yearly`, the medium ground finches of Beausoleil et
al. (2019); and `finch_community`, the five finch groups of Beausoleil
et al. (2023). Most examples below use simulated data; sections 5.16,
5.17 and 7.0 use `finch_yearly` and `bumpus`.

[`run_app()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/run_app.md)
runs the same workflow in a browser, on four of these datasets (all but
`finch_yearly`) or an uploaded CSV, and writes out the R calls that
repeat the analysis with its settings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Detailed Function Reference

#### 5.1 `prepare_selection_data()`

**Purpose:** Preprocesses raw data for selection analysis.

``` r

prepare_selection_data(
  data, # Data frame
  fitness_col, # Name of fitness column (character)
  trait_cols, # Vector of trait column names
  standardize = TRUE, # Standardise traits to mean 0, SD 1
  group = NULL, # Standardise and relativise within this column (e.g. year)
  add_relative = TRUE, # Add relative fitness column
  na_action = c("warn", "drop", "none"), # How to handle NAs
  name_relative = "relative_fitness" # Name for relative fitness column
)
```

**Returns:** Modified data frame with:

- Standardised traits (if `standardize = TRUE`)
- Relative fitness column (if `add_relative = TRUE`)
- Potentially dropped NA rows (if `na_action = "drop"`)

**Example:**

``` r

set.seed(42)

raw_data <- data.frame(
  survival = rbinom(100, 1, 0.6),
  size = rnorm(100, 10, 2),
  colour = rnorm(100, 5, 1)
)

prepared <- prepare_selection_data(
  data = raw_data,
  fitness_col = "survival",
  trait_cols = c("size", "colour"),
  standardize = TRUE,
  add_relative = TRUE,
  na_action = "drop"
)

cat("size:", nrow(prepared), "\n")
#> size: 100
head(prepared)
#>   survival       size      colour relative_fitness
#> 1        0  0.3732348 -0.03515215         0.000000
#> 2        0 -0.8154449 -1.65383838         0.000000
#> 3        1  1.7210532  1.25893003         1.851852
#> 4        0  0.7182770 -0.28472648         0.000000
#> 5        0  0.1236614 -0.49278752         0.000000
#> 6        1  0.3244579 -1.31818396         1.851852
```

#### 5.2 `detect_family()`

**Purpose:** Automatically determines whether fitness is binary, count
or continuous.

``` r

detect_family(y) # y = fitness vector
```

**Logic:**

- **Binary** if all values are 0 or 1 (a warning if there are fewer than
  10 of them)
- **Count** if all values are non-negative whole numbers
- **Continuous** otherwise, including proportions and relative fitness

**Returns:** List with:

- `$type`: “binary”, “count” or “continuous”
- `$family`: the GLM family the p-value model starts from (binomial,
  Poisson or Gaussian)

**Example:**

``` r

# Binary fitness
fitness_binary <- c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1)
detect_family(fitness_binary)
#> $type
#> [1] "binary"
#> 
#> $family
#> 
#> Family: binomial 
#> Link function: logit 
#> 
#> 
#> $note
#> [1] "Binary fitness (0/1) detected. Use logistic GLM for p-values."

# Continuous fitness
fitness_cont <- c(2.3, 4.1, 3.2, 5.6, 1.8)
detect_family(fitness_cont)
#> $type
#> [1] "continuous"
#> 
#> $family
#> 
#> Family: gaussian 
#> Link function: identity 
#> 
#> 
#> $note
#> [1] "Continuous fitness detected. Using Gaussian family."
```

#### 5.3 `selection_differential()`

**Purpose:** Calculates the selection differential ($`S`$) for a single
trait.

``` r

selection_differential(
  data,
  fitness_col,
  trait_col,
  standardized = TRUE, # Whether trait is already standardised
  use_relative = TRUE # Use relative fitness
)
```

**Formula:** $`S = \mathrm{Cov}(z, w)`$

When traits are standardised ($`\bar{z} = 0`$), this simplifies to:
``` math
S = \mathbb{E}(z \times w) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n z_i w_i
```

**Example:**

``` r

# Calculate selection differential for size
S_size <- selection_differential(
  data = prepared,
  fitness_col = "relative_fitness",
  trait_col = "size",
  standardized = TRUE,
  use_relative = TRUE
)

# Calculate for colour
S_colour <- selection_differential(
  data = prepared,
  fitness_col = "relative_fitness",
  trait_col = "colour",
  standardized = TRUE,
  use_relative = TRUE
)

cat("Selection Differentials (S):\n")
#> Selection Differentials (S):
cat("Size :", round(S_size, 4), "\n")
#> Size : -0.1126
cat("Colour:", round(S_colour, 4), "\n")
#> Colour: -0.0078
```

#### 5.4 `analyze_linear_selection()`

**Purpose:** Estimates linear selection gradients
($`\boldsymbol{\beta}`$) with comprehensive diagnostics.

``` r

analyze_linear_selection(
  data,
  fitness_col,
  trait_cols,
  fitness_type # "binary", "count" or "continuous"
)
```

**Features:**

- Sample size checks (warning if n \< 10)
- Missing data handling
- Convergence checks for GLM
- Type III ANOVA (if `car` package available)
- Separation detection for binary models

**Returns:** List containing:

- `$model`: the fitted lm for continuous fitness; for binary and count
  fitness a list with `$ols` (the gradient model) and `$glm` (the model
  the p-values come from)
- `$summary`: Model summary, or a list of the two summaries
- `$anova`: Type III ANOVA table (if available)

**Example:**

``` r

linear_results <- analyze_linear_selection(
  data = prepared,
  fitness_col = "relative_fitness",
  trait_cols = c("size", "colour"),
  fitness_type = "continuous"
)

# View coefficients
summary(linear_results$model)
#> 
#> Call:
#> lm(formula = as.formula(paste(fitness_col, "~", rhs)), data = fit_data)
#> 
#> Residuals:

#> Residual standard error: 0.93 on 97 degrees of freedom
#> Multiple R-squared:  0.01504,    Adjusted R-squared:  -0.00527 
#> F-statistic: 0.7405 on 2 and 97 DF,  p-value: 0.4795
```

#### 5.5 `analyze_nonlinear_selection()`

**Purpose:** Estimates quadratic ($`\gamma_{ii}`$) and correlational
($`\gamma_{ij}`$) selection gradients.

``` r

analyze_nonlinear_selection(
  data,
  fitness_col,
  trait_cols,
  fitness_type
)
```

**Model specification:** Automatically constructs:

- Linear terms: $`z_i`$
- Quadratic terms: $`z_i^2`$
- Interaction terms: $`z_i \times z_j`$ (for i \< j)

**Diagnostics:**

- Sample size checks (n \< 20 warning)
- Variance inflation factors (VIF \> 5 warning)
- Convergence monitoring for GLM

**Example:**

``` r

nonlinear_results <- analyze_nonlinear_selection(
  data = prepared,
  fitness_col = "relative_fitness",
  trait_cols = c("size", "colour"),
  fitness_type = "continuous"
)

#### 5.6 `analyze_disruptive_selection()`

**Purpose:** Specialised function for detecting disruptive or
stabilising selection on a single trait.

``` r

analyze_disruptive_selection(
  data,
  fitness_col,
  trait_col,
  fitness_type = c("auto", "binary", "count", "continuous"),
  standardize = TRUE,
  group = NULL
)
```

**Models:** $`\beta`$ comes from the linear-only model $`w \sim z`$ and
$`\gamma = 2 b_2`$ from $`w \sim z + z^2`$ (with the standard error
doubled as well), following Lande & Arnold (1983) and Stinchcombe et
al. (2008). Both are computed through
[`selection_coefficients()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/selection_coefficients.md)
on the single trait.

**Returns:** Data frame with:

- Linear term ($`\beta`$): Directional selection
- Quadratic term ($`\gamma = 2 \times b_2`$): Disruptive (positive) or
  stabilising (negative)

**Example:**

``` r

disruptive_test <- analyze_disruptive_selection(
  data = prepared,
  fitness_col = "relative_fitness",
  trait_col = "size",
  fitness_type = "continuous"
)

print(disruptive_test)
#>    Term      Type Beta_Coefficient Standard_Error   P_Value    Variance
#> 1  size    Linear       -0.1137538     0.09299531 0.2241794 0.008648127
#> 2 size² Quadratic       -0.1971818     0.11967907 0.1026730 0.014323079
```

#### 5.7 `univariate_spline()`

**Purpose:** Fits a flexible nonparametric fitness function using GAMs.

``` r

univariate_spline(
  data,
  fitness_col,
  trait_col,
  fitness_type = c("auto", "binary", "count", "continuous"),
  group = NULL,        # optional group fixed effect
  relative_col = NULL, # pre-computed relative fitness column, if any
  k = 10,              # basis dimension
  bs = "cr",           # spline basis: "cr", "tp" or "ps"
  smoothing = "GCV.Cp", # how the smoothing parameter is chosen: "GCV.Cp", "REML" or "ML"
  bootstrap = FALSE,   # TRUE: percentile-bootstrap 95% ribbon (Schluter 1988)
  n_boot = 1000
)
```

**Technical details:**

- Penalised cubic regression spline (`bs = "cr"`) with the smoothing
  parameter chosen by generalised cross-validation, following Schluter
  (1988). `bs` and `smoothing` exist to match the smoother another study
  used; they change the family of curves, not how much the data are
  smoothed, which is always chosen from the data. A warning is given if
  mgcv’s check suggests `k` left the curve too little room to bend.
- For binary fitness: binomial GAM with logit link on the raw 0/1
  values; for counts: Poisson GAM with log link on the raw counts; for
  continuous fitness: Gaussian GAM on relative fitness
- 95% band: parametric (Wald) by default, or a percentile bootstrap over
  individuals with `bootstrap = TRUE`

**Example:**

``` r

# k is capped from the number of distinct trait values; the default is fine here
spline_fit <- univariate_spline(
  data = prepared,
  fitness_col = "survival",
  trait_col = "size",
  fitness_type = "binary",
  bootstrap = TRUE
)

head(spline_fit$grid)
#>        size       fit          lwr       upr
#> 1 -3.190356 0.4562304 3.693586e-07 0.9999977

#> 6 -3.036537 0.4708582 1.503094e-06 0.9999933
```

#### 5.8 `plot_univariate_fitness()`

**Purpose:** Visualises univariate correlated fitness functions with
confidence bands.

``` r

plot_univariate_fitness(
  uni, # Output from univariate_spline()
  trait_col,
  title = NULL
)
```

**Returns:** ggplot2 object with line plot and 95% confidence bands.

**Example:**

``` r

p <- plot_univariate_fitness(
  spline_fit,
  "size",
  title = "Correlated Fitness Function: Body Size"
)
print(p)
```

size](evolutionary-selection-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

Figure 1. Correlated fitness function for body size

#### 5.9 `correlated_fitness_surface()`

**Purpose:** Estimates 2D fitness surfaces using thin-plate splines
(continuous) or GAMs (binary and count fitness).

``` r

correlated_fitness_surface(
  data,
  fitness_col,
  trait_cols, # Exactly 2 traits
  grid_n = 60, # Grid resolution (grid_n × grid_n points)
  method = "auto", # "auto", "gam", or "tps"
  scale_traits = FALSE, # Traits are normally standardised upstream
  group = NULL, # Optional grouping column, e.g. species or year
  group_effect = TRUE, # Group as a fixed effect in the model, or FALSE to use it only for the overlay
  k = NULL, # Basis dimension for the GAM smooth; set from the data if NULL
  mask = TRUE, # Leave grid points outside the data blank
  too_far = NULL, # Also blank cells farther than this share of the range from any individual
  bs = "tp", # GAM basis: "tp", "cr" or "ps"
  smoothing = "REML", # GAM smoothing parameter choice: "REML", "GCV.Cp" or "ML"
  clamp = TRUE, # Hold thin-plate predictions within the range of the fitness type
  level = 0.95, # Confidence level of the band around a GAM surface
  by_group = FALSE # TRUE: a separate surface for each group, returned as a named list
)
```

**Method selection:**

- `"tps"`: Uses
  [`fields::Tps()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/fields/man/Tps.html) for
  continuous fitness (spline-based)
- `"gam"`: Uses [`mgcv::gam()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/gam.html)
  with a thin-plate smooth and REML smoothing (works for all three). The
  family follows the fitness column: binomial for 0/1, Poisson with a
  log link for counts such as recapture years or offspring, Gaussian
  otherwise. `bs` and `smoothing` swap in another basis or criterion to
  match a published analysis; with `"cr"` or `"ps"` the two traits enter
  as a tensor product.
- `"auto"`: Chooses based on fitness type (GAM for binary and count, TPS
  for continuous)

**Basis dimension:** with `k = NULL` the GAM uses
`min(30, max(10, floor(sqrt(n1 * n2))))`, where `n1` and `n2` are the
numbers of distinct values of each trait, capped at one less than the
number of observations. Pass an integer to override it.

**Masking:** the fitted surface is evaluated on a rectangular grid, and
the corners of that rectangle are usually places no individual occupies.
With `mask = TRUE` grid points outside the convex hull of the observed
trait pairs get `NA` fitness, so the optimum is found within the data,
and the plots draw the surface up to the hull and leave the outside
blank. The grid keeps the unmasked predictions in `.fit_all`, records
which points were kept in `.inside`, and the result carries the hull
polygon in `$hull`. The hull still bridges gaps between separate
clusters of individuals, such as two species on one surface. `too_far`
adds the distance rule from
[`mgcv::vis.gam`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/vis.gam.html): after
scaling the grid to the unit square, cells farther than `too_far` from
the nearest individual are blanked as well, and the distance is kept in
`.dist`. Beausoleil et al. (2023) used 0.15. The default applies no
distance rule.

**Separate fits:** `by_group = TRUE`, here and in
[`univariate_spline()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/univariate_spline.md),
fits each group on its own rows and returns a named list, rather than
one shape shifted by a group term. Prepare the data with the same
`group` so each is standardised on its own, and plot with
[`lapply()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/lapply.html).

**Groups:** with `group` the GAM includes the column as a fixed effect
and predicts the surface at the reference level, as the gradient models
do for year or site. `group_effect = FALSE` fits one surface to everyone
and uses the group only for the overlay, which is what a community
surface of several species needs. The result’s `$groups` table gives,
for each group, its size, its mean of both traits and the highest point
of the surface within that group’s own convex hull, with `peak_interior`
saying whether that point is a peak of the surface and `peak_edge`
whether it sits at the edge of the data; when both are `FALSE` the
surface keeps rising past the group’s range. The plots mark the means as
labelled open circles and the peaks as triangles, filled for a peak and
open otherwise, which is how Beausoleil et al. (2023) placed several
species on one surface. `$peaks` lists every local maximum of the kept
surface the same way, and the gold optimum becomes an open diamond when
the highest cell sits at the edge of the data.

**Returns:** List containing:

- `$model`: Fitted model object
- `$grid`: Data frame with trait values, predicted fitness (`.fit`,
  masked), `.fit_all` and `.inside`; with the GAM also the standard
  error of the fit (`.se`) and its band (`.fit_lo`, `.fit_hi`)
- `$hull`: The convex hull of the data, used by the plots
- `$original_data`: The rows that were analysed
- `$peaks`: The local maxima of the kept surface, highest first,
  `interior` `TRUE` for a peak inside the data, `FALSE` for a maximum at
  its edge
- `$groups`: With `group`, one row per group with its mean traits and
  highest point, flagged `peak_interior` and `peak_edge`
- `$method`: Method used
- `$k`: Basis dimension used (GAM method)
- `$data_type`: “binary”, “count” or “continuous”

**Example:** survival is binary, so the raw 0/1 column goes in and a
binomial GAM is fitted.

``` r

surface <- correlated_fitness_surface(
  data = prepared,
  fitness_col = "survival",
  trait_cols = c("size", "colour"),
  method = "gam"
)

# Find optimum (maximum fitness)
optimum <- surface$grid[which.max(surface$grid$.fit), ]
print(optimum)
#>            size    colour      .fit       .se  .fit_lo   .fit_hi  .fit_all
#> 2248 -0.3887548 0.5928513 0.7006815 0.1199263 0.432857 0.8777501 0.7006815
#>        .se_all .fit_lo_all .fit_hi_all .inside
#> 2248 0.1199263    0.432857   0.8777501    TRUE
```

#### 5.10 `plot_correlated_fitness()`

**Purpose:** Visualise 2D fitness surfaces with contour plots.

``` r

plot_correlated_fitness(
  tps,                  # Output from correlated_fitness_surface()
  trait_cols,           # The two trait names
  bins = 12,            # Number of contour bins
  show_optimum = TRUE,  # Mark the highest fitness: gold diamond inside the data, open at its edge
  show_groups = TRUE,   # Mark group means and highest points when the surface has a group
  group_lines = TRUE,   # Dashed line from each group's mean to its peak
  uncertainty = "none", # "se": standard error lines; "band": lower, fit and upper panels
  ...                   # Passed to ggplot2::labs(), e.g. title or fill
)

plot_correlated_fitness_enhanced(
  tps,                  # Output from correlated_fitness_surface()
  trait_cols,
  original_data,        # Individuals to overlay, coloured by fitness
  fitness_col,
  bins = 12,
  uncertainty = "none"
)
```

**Uncertainty:** a GAM surface carries the standard error of its fitted
fitness and a band around it, worked out on the scale of the link.
`uncertainty = "se"` draws the standard error as dashed contour lines
over the surface, and `uncertainty = "band"` draws the lower bound, the
fit and the upper bound side by side on one fill scale.
`peak_difference(surface, from, to, valley = TRUE)` gives the difference
in fitted fitness between two points, given as group names or trait
values, and between each of them and the lowest point on the line
joining them, with standard errors from the covariance of the model’s
coefficients. The thin-plate spline gives no standard errors.

**Example:**

``` r

p <- plot_correlated_fitness(
  tps = surface,
  trait_cols = c("size", "colour"),
  bins = 12
)

print(p)
```

)

print(p)

#### 5.11 `adaptive_landscape()`

**Purpose:** Calculates the Wrightian adaptive landscape, which is a
population-level concept distinct from correlated fitness surfaces.

``` r

adaptive_landscape(
  data,                      # Individual-level data frame
  fitness_model,             # $model from correlated_fitness_surface() or univariate_spline()
  trait_cols,                # One or two trait names
  group_col = NULL,          # Optional grouping column (e.g., "species")
  population_variance = NULL,# Within-population variance-covariance matrix
  simulation_n = 1000,       # Number of individuals to simulate per grid point
  grid_n = 50,               # Grid resolution (grid_n × grid_n)
  custom_range = NULL,       # Optional custom range for population means
  clamp = TRUE,              # Hold thin-plate fitness within the range of the fitness type
  support_warn = 0.25        # Share outside the data at the optimum that draws a note
)
```

**Calculation Steps:**

1.  Create grid of possible population means ($`\bar{z}_1`$,
    $`\bar{z}_2`$) across the trait range
2.  Estimate within-population variance from the data
3.  Simulate individuals around each population mean:
    $`\mathbf{z} \sim \mathrm{N}(\bar{\mathbf{z}}, \mathbf{P})`$
4.  Predict fitness for each simulated individual using the fitted model
5.  Calculate mean fitness
    $`\bar{W} = \frac{1}{N}\sum \hat{w}_{\text{ind}}`$
6.  Find optimum - the population mean that maximises $`\bar{W}`$

The simulated populations spread beyond the data, more so towards the
edge of the grid, and the fitness of those individuals is extrapolated.
The function reports how far this goes, as the share of each simulated
population falling outside the convex hull of the observed traits, and
says so when the optimum rests on it.

**Returns:**

- `$grid`: Population means with mean fitness (`.mean_fit`); with one
  trait also the fitness function at those means (`.ind_fit`)
- `$optimum`: Population mean with highest fitness
- `$support`: Share of simulated individuals outside the data, over the
  grid (`outside`) and at the optimum (`at_optimum`); per population
  mean in the grid’s `.outside`
- `$actual_population_means`: Actual means (if group_col provided)

**An optimum on the edge of the grid:** this usually means the true
optimum lies outside the observed traits. `custom_range`, a named list
with one range per trait, moves or widens the grid, but fitness out
there is extrapolated, and `$support` says how much of the simulated
population that involves.

With a single trait the grid is a line of population means, the model is
normally the `$model` of
[`univariate_spline()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/univariate_spline.md),
and the result is a curve rather than a surface.

**Example:**

``` r

landscape <- adaptive_landscape(
  data = prepared,
  fitness_model = surface$model,
  trait_cols = c("size", "colour"),
  grid_n = 50,
  simulation_n = 1000
)

landscape$optimum
#>            size     colour .mean_fit .outside
#> 1173 -0.5666342 -0.1465932 0.5624699    0.138
```

#### 5.12 `plot_adaptive_landscape()`

**Purpose:** Creates a 2D contour map showing how mean fitness varies
with population mean phenotypes, or, for a single trait, a curve of mean
fitness against the population mean with the fitness function drawn
dashed alongside it.

``` r

plot_adaptive_landscape(
  landscape,                  # Output from adaptive_landscape()
  trait_cols,                 # One or two trait column names
  original_data = NULL,       # Optional original data for overlaying points
  group_col = NULL,           # Optional grouping column for labels
  bins = 12,                  # Number of contour bins
  show_optimum = TRUE,        # Show optimal population mean (gold diamond)
  show_actual_means = TRUE,   # Show actual population means (red points)
  show_individual = TRUE,     # One trait: also draw the fitness function
  show_support = FALSE,       # Mark where most of the simulated population leaves the data
  support_level = 0.5         # The share outside the data at which that line is drawn
)

plot_adaptive_landscape_3d(
  landscape,                  # Output from adaptive_landscape()
  trait_cols,                 # Two trait column names
  theta = -30,                # Azimuthal rotation angle
  phi = 30                    # Colatitude tilt angle
)
```

**Example:**

``` r

p <- plot_adaptive_landscape(
  landscape = landscape,
  trait_cols = c("size", "colour"),
  bins = 12
)

print(p)
```

#### 5.13 `selection_coefficients()`

**Purpose:** Main wrapper function that runs a complete selection
analysis.

``` r

selection_coefficients(
  data,
  fitness_col,
  trait_cols,
  fitness_type = c("auto", "binary", "count", "continuous"),
  standardize = TRUE,
  group = NULL,               # optional grouping column (e.g. year)
  use_relative_for_fit = TRUE,
  return_grouped = FALSE      # TRUE: one set of gradients per group
)
```

**Workflow:**

1.  Prepares data (standardisation, relative fitness)
2.  Detects fitness type (if `auto`)
3.  Runs linear selection analysis
4.  Runs nonlinear selection analysis
5.  Extracts all coefficients into a single table

**Returns:** Data frame with columns:

- `Term`: Coefficient name (e.g., “size”, “size²”, “size×colour”)
- `Type`: “Linear”, “Quadratic”, or “Correlational”
- `Beta_Coefficient`: Estimated selection gradient
- `Standard_Error`: Standard error of estimate
- `P_Value`: Statistical significance
- `Variance`: Square of standard error

**Example:**

``` r

results_binary <- selection_coefficients(
  data = prepared,
  fitness_col = "survival", # Binary 0/1
  trait_cols = c("size", "colour"), # Only available traits
  fitness_type = "binary",
  standardize = TRUE
)

print(results_binary)
#>            Term          Type Beta_Coefficient Standard_Error    P_Value

#> 3 0.017982567
#> 4 0.025876841
#> 5 0.011103499
```

The table is put together by three exported helpers,
[`extract_linear_coefficients()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/extract_linear_coefficients.md),
[`extract_quadratic_coefficients()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/extract_quadratic_coefficients.md)
and
[`extract_interaction_coefficients()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/extract_interaction_coefficients.md).
Each takes the trait names and the model object from
[`analyze_linear_selection()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/analyze_linear_selection.md)
or
[`analyze_nonlinear_selection()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/analyze_nonlinear_selection.md),
pulls the terms out by name, doubles the quadratic estimates and skips
any term the model does not have. They are only needed if you fit the
models yourself and want the same table.

#### 5.14 One-call wrappers

The full workflow is available in one call through
[`selection_coefficients()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/selection_coefficients.md)
(the coefficient table) and
[`selection_report()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/selection_report.md)
(differentials and gradients in a single standardised table):

``` r

selection_report(prepared, "survival", c("size", "colour"), fitness_type = "binary")

```

#### 5.15 `compare_fitness_surfaces_data()`

**Purpose:** Compares the individual-level fitness surface with the
population-level adaptive landscape: their optima, the distance between
them, summary statistics and the correlation between the two surfaces.
The surface is selection on individuals and the landscape is where the
population mean would move, so the two can peak in different places.

``` r

comparison <- compare_fitness_surfaces_data(
  correlated_surface = surface,
  adaptive_landscape = landscape,
  trait_cols = c("size", "colour")
)

#### 5.16 `temporal_landscape()` and `plot_temporal_landscape()`

**Purpose:** Fit the fitness function or surface, and optionally the
adaptive landscape, separately for each period, to see how selection
changes over time.

``` r

temporal_landscape(
  data,                  # Traits standardised once, over all periods
  fitness_col,
  trait_cols,            # One or two traits
  time_col,              # The period of each row, usually year
  fitness_type = "auto",
  min_n = 20,            # Periods with fewer rows are skipped
  landscape = TRUE,      # Also the adaptive landscape per period
  bootstrap = FALSE,     # Band around each period's fitness function (one trait)
  grid_n = 60, simulation_n = 300
)

plot_temporal_landscape(
  tl,
  type = "panels",       # or "heatmap" for one trait
  show_points = TRUE, show_landscape = TRUE, show_optimum = TRUE,
  ncol = NULL            # Panel columns
)
```

**Returns:** a list with one fit and one landscape per period, a
`summary` table (n, mean fitness, trait means, the smooth’s degrees of
freedom, the position and height of the highest fitness and whether it
sits at the edge of the data, the number of interior peaks for one
trait, and the landscape optimum), the fitted values of every period
stacked in `grid`, for one trait the fitness functions on a common grid
in `heat` (blank where a period has no individuals), and the periods
skipped for having fewer than `min_n` rows.

Standardise the traits once, over all periods, before calling: the
periods must share one trait axis, so nothing is restandardised per
period. The number of peaks depends on the basis size `k` as any spline
feature does; treat it as a description of the fitted curve, and test
disruptive selection with the quadratic gradient on the birds between
the peaks as Beausoleil et al. (2019) did.

**Example:** medium ground finches at El Garrapatero, one row per bird
per year it was seen, survival to the next year against beak size (first
principal component of the three beak medians), from the public data of
Beausoleil et al. (2019).

``` r

finch_prep <- prepare_selection_data(finch_yearly, "survived", "beak_pc1")
years <- temporal_landscape(finch_prep, "survived", "beak_pc1", "year", simulation_n = 200)
```

``` r

years$summary[, c("time", "n", "mean_fitness", "edf", "optimum_beak_pc1", "peaks")]
#>   time   n mean_fitness      edf optimum_beak_pc1 peaks

```

![The same fitness functions as a heat map, blank where a year has no
birds.](evolutionary-selection-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)

The same fitness functions as a heat map, blank where a year has no
birds.

The spline finds more than one peak in 2005 and 2008 and a steep rise
towards large beaks in 2009, the year with the strongest selection in
Beausoleil et al. (2019). Peaks in a fitted curve are a description, not
a test; their test was the quadratic gradient on the birds between the
peaks, which is
[`analyze_disruptive_selection()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/analyze_disruptive_selection.md)
in section 5.6 run on that subset.

#### 5.17 `canonical_analysis()` and `plot_canonical_axes()`

**Purpose:** Rotate the matrix of quadratic and correlational gradients
to its canonical axes and read the curvature along each.

``` r

canonical_analysis(
  data, fitness_col, trait_cols,
  fitness_type = "auto",
  standardize = TRUE,
  group = NULL,        # Standardise and relativise within groups, as the gradients do
  bootstrap = FALSE,   # Percentile intervals for the eigenvalues
  n_boot = 200,
  conf = 0.95
)
```

**Returns:** the gamma matrix, $`\beta`$, the loadings `M` with one
column per axis, and an `axes` table with each eigenvalue $`\lambda`$,
its standard error and p-value from the double regression of Bisgaard
and Ankenman (1996), and the directional selection along the axis,
$`\theta = \mathbf{M}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}`$. The prepared data come
back with the canonical scores `m1`, `m2`, … added.

``` r

ca <- canonical_analysis(bumpus, "survival", c("total_length", "weight", "humerus"))
ca
#> Canonical analysis of gamma for total_length, weight, humerus on 136 individuals
#> 
#> Loadings (columns are the canonical axes):
#>                  m1     m2    m3
#> total_length -0.256 -0.056 0.965
#> weight        0.590  0.782 0.202
#> humerus       0.766 -0.621 0.167
#> 
#> Curvature along each axis (negative stabilising, positive disruptive):
#>  axis  lambda     se p_value  theta
#>    m1  0.0331 0.1138   0.678  0.281
#>    m2 -0.0248 0.2509   0.661 -0.507
#>    m3 -0.1511 0.0988   0.125 -0.282
#> 
#> The axes come from these data, so the tests are anticonservative.
```

A negative $`\lambda`$ is curvature along that axis, consistent with
stabilising selection, and a positive one with disruptive selection,
exactly as for $`\gamma_{ii}`$. The tests treat the axes as known when
they were estimated from the same data, so they are anticonservative
(Reynolds et al., 2010). Sampling error in $`\boldsymbol{\gamma}`$ also
spreads its eigenvalues, so the largest curvatures are overestimated,
more so with many traits and few individuals (Morrissey, 2014).
`bootstrap = TRUE` gives percentile intervals, with each resample’s axes
matched to the original ones, and
[`plot_canonical_axes()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/plot_canonical_axes.md)
draws the fitness surface along any two axes, or the fitness function
along one, which is where to check whether a curved axis has a peak
inside the data.

``` r

plot_canonical_axes(ca, which = c(1, 3), grid_n = 30)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Interpretation Guide

#### 6.1 Statistical Significance

The p-values test whether each gradient differs from zero. Treat them as
a guide to how much the data say, not as the size of selection: a
gradient of 0.05 with p \< 0.001 is well estimated but weak, and a
gradient of 0.4 with p = 0.08 may matter more. Report the estimate and
its standard error or bootstrap interval alongside the p-value.

#### 6.2 Selection Types

**Linear Selection ($`\beta`$):**

| $`\beta`$ sign | Interpretation                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Positive (+)   | Selection favours larger trait values  |
| Negative (-)   | Selection favours smaller trait values |
| Zero (0)       | No directional selection               |

**Quadratic Selection ($`\gamma`$):**

| $`\gamma`$ sign | Interpretation         | Shape    |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------|
| Negative (-)    | Stabilising selection  | ∩-shaped |
| Positive (+)    | Disruptive selection   | ∪-shaped |
| Zero (0)        | No nonlinear selection | Linear   |

**Correlational Selection ($`\gamma_{ij}`$):**

| $`\gamma_{ij}`$ sign | Interpretation | Shape of the surface |
|----|----|----|
| Positive (+) | Selection favours positive correlation (both traits high or both low) | A ridge running from low-low to high-high; the two off-diagonal corners are valleys |
| Negative (-) | Selection favours negative correlation (one high, one low) | A ridge running from high-low to low-high |
| Zero (0) | Traits evolve independently | Contours are symmetric about both axes |

The classic example is Brodie (1992) on garter snakes: neither colour
pattern nor escape behaviour was under strong selection on its own, but
striped snakes that fled in a straight line and unstriped snakes that
reversed direction both survived better than the mismatched
combinations. That is positive correlational selection between two
traits, visible as a ridge across the fitness surface rather than as a
peak on either axis.

#### 6.3 Effect Sizes

**For standardised traits ($`\mu=0, \sigma=1`$):**

| $`|\beta|`$ | Effect size        |
|-------------|--------------------|
| \< 0.1      | Weak selection     |
| 0.1 - 0.3   | Moderate selection |
| \> 0.3      | Strong selection   |

These bands are relative to the published record: across the studies
collated by Kingsolver et al. (2001) the median $`|\beta|`$ was 0.16 and
the median $`|\gamma|`$ was 0.10, so a gradient above 0.3 is stronger
than most selection measured in the wild. Gradients standardised by the
trait mean instead of its standard deviation put traits with different
variances on one scale, and Hereford et al. (2004) collate the record on
that scale; the package reports variance-standardised gradients only.

#### 6.4 Example Interpretations

    Scenario 1: β_size = 0.25, p = 0.001
    → "Body size experiences significant positive directional selection.
       A one-standard-deviation increase in size increases relative fitness by 0.25 units."

    Scenario 2: γ_size = -0.15, p = 0.02
    → "Body size shows significant stabilising selection.
       Intermediate sizes have highest fitness; extremes are disadvantageous."

    Scenario 3: γ_size x beak = 0.32, p = 0.004
    → "Significant positive correlational selection between size and beak depth.
       Selection favours individuals that are either both large or both small."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Troubleshooting and Common Issues

#### 7.0 Check the Assumptions First

[`check_selection_assumptions()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/check_selection_assumptions.md)
puts the checks a Lande and Arnold analysis rests on in one table:
Mardia’s tests of multivariate normality of the traits, which is what
lets the gradients be read as the slope and curvature of the fitness
surface (Lande & Arnold, 1983; Morrissey & Sakrejda, 2013; they equal
$`\mathbf{P}^{-1}\mathbf{S}`$ by least squares whatever the
distribution), Shapiro-Wilk for each trait, the largest VIF, the
individuals (for survival, the rarer outcome) per quadratic term, and
for the gradient models residual normality and heteroscedasticity,
separation, or the dispersion ratio. With the `performance` package
installed it adds that package’s heteroscedasticity and overdispersion
tests and an R squared. Palacio et al. (2019) set out what to report;
this table is meant to sit beside the gradients.

``` r

check_selection_assumptions(bumpus, "survival", c("total_length", "weight", "humerus"))
#> Assumption checks (binary fitness, n = 136)
#> 
#>  check                                    statistic p    
#>  Multivariate normality: Mardia skewness  1.05      0.006
#>  Multivariate normality: Mardia kurtosis    15      0.997
#>  Normality of total_length (Shapiro-Wilk) 0.978     0.029
#>  Normality of weight (Shapiro-Wilk)       0.97      0.004
#>  Normality of humerus (Shapiro-Wilk)      0.98      0.048
#>  Collinearity: largest VIF                1.75

#>  not normal                                                
#>  not normal

#>  64 of the rarer outcome for 9 terms; treat gamma with care
#>  no sign of separation                                     
#> 
```

#### 7.1 Sample Size Recommendations

| Analysis                      | Minimum n    | Recommended n   |
|-------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Linear selection (continuous) | 10           | \> 30           |
| Linear selection (binary)     | 20 per group | \> 50 per group |
| Nonlinear selection           | 20           | \> 100          |
| Bivariate TPS                 | 30           | \> 200          |

The nonlinear model grows quickly with the number of traits: $`m`$
traits give $`m`$ linear, $`m`$ quadratic and $`m(m-1)/2`$ correlational
terms, so nine traits mean 54 terms. Allow about ten individuals per
term, and for binary fitness about ten survivors (or deaths, whichever
is rarer) per term; below that the quadratic and correlational estimates
are noise with p-values attached. Choose fewer traits on biological
grounds rather than fitting them all.

#### 7.2 Convergence Issues in Binary Models

**Symptoms:**

- Very large coefficients (\> 10)
- Extremely large standard errors
- Warning about “complete separation”

**Solutions:**

``` r

# 1. Check for complete separation
table(data$fitness, cut(data$trait, 5))

# 2. Use Firth's penalised likelihood
if (!require("logistf")) install.packages("logistf")
library(logistf)
fit <- logistf(fitness ~ trait, data = data)

# 3. Collect more data
# 4. Simplify model (fewer traits)
```

#### 7.3 Missing Data

[`prepare_selection_data()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/prepare_selection_data.md)
checks the fitness and trait columns for `NA`. The default,
`na_action = "warn"`, keeps every row and warns with the count. The
models drop incomplete rows themselves, and traits and relative fitness
are standardised on the rows that are analysed, so the rows that fall
out do not shift the means. Rows with a missing group label are kept and
treated as their own group. `na_action = "drop"` removes incomplete rows
up front and prints how many went, which keeps the sample size explicit
and is the better choice when the same data go on to the splines and
surfaces.

``` r

# Where are the gaps, and how many rows do they cost?
colSums(is.na(data[, c(fitness_col, trait_cols)]))
sum(!complete.cases(data[, c(fitness_col, trait_cols)]))

prepared <- prepare_selection_data(data, fitness_col, trait_cols, na_action = "drop")
```

Imputing traits is possible but changes what is being estimated. With
more than a few percent of rows incomplete, report the count and analyse
the complete cases.

#### 7.4 Multicollinearity

High correlations between traits can inflate standard errors:

``` r

# Check correlations
cor(data[, trait_cols])

# Calculate VIF
if (requireNamespace("car", quietly = TRUE)) {
  vif_vals <- car::vif(model)
  # VIF > 5 is flagged by the package; > 10 is serious
}
```

**Solutions:**

- Use ridge regression
- Collect more data

#### 7.5 Reduced k Warning

[`univariate_spline()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/univariate_spline.md)
warns “Reducing k from 10 to …” when a trait has fewer distinct values
than the basis asks for, which happens with small groups, single years
or coarsely measured traits. The curve is then less flexible than the
default. To set the basis size yourself, in the spline or the surface:

``` r

uni <- univariate_spline(prepared, "survival", "size", k = 5)
surface <- correlated_fitness_surface(prepared, "survival", c("size", "colour"), k = 15)
```
