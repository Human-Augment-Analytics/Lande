# Plot fitness functions and landscapes over time

Plot fitness functions and landscapes over time

## Usage

``` r
plot_temporal_landscape(
  tl,
  type = c("panels", "heatmap"),
  show_points = TRUE,
  show_landscape = TRUE,
  show_optimum = TRUE,
  connect = FALSE,
  bins = 10,
  ncol = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- tl:

  Output of
  [`temporal_landscape()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/temporal_landscape.md).

- type:

  `"panels"` draws one panel per period: the fitness function with its
  band and the individuals for one trait, the fitness surface for two.
  `"heatmap"`, for one trait only, draws fitness against trait and
  period in one panel, with the position of the highest fitness in each
  period marked.

- show_points:

  Logical; draw the individuals in each panel.

- show_landscape:

  Logical; for one trait, also draw each period's adaptive landscape as
  a dashed curve.

- show_optimum:

  Logical; mark the highest fitted fitness in each period, as a gold
  diamond when it lies inside the data and an open one when it sits at
  the edge of the range.

- connect:

  Logical; in the heat map, join the highest fitness of successive
  periods with a line. Default is `FALSE`, since a maximum at the edge
  of the range is not a peak.

- bins:

  Contour bins for two-trait panels.

- ncol:

  Number of panel columns.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [`ggplot2::labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html).

## Value

A `ggplot` object.

## Examples

``` r
prep <- prepare_selection_data(finch_yearly, "survived", "beak_pc1")
years <- temporal_landscape(prep, "survived", "beak_pc1", "year", landscape = FALSE)
#> 2004: n = 110, mean fitness 0.345, edf 3.0, 1 interior peak, highest fitness at the edge of the data
#> 2005: n = 185, mean fitness 0.276, edf 5.2, 3 interior peaks
#> 2006: n = 233, mean fitness 0.180, edf 4.4, 2 interior peaks
#> 2007: n = 61, mean fitness 0.344, edf 2.7, 1 interior peak
#> 2008: n = 127, mean fitness 0.307, edf 7.0, 3 interior peaks, highest fitness at the edge of the data
#> 2009: n = 196, mean fitness 0.194, edf 4.8, 1 interior peak, highest fitness at the edge of the data
#> 2010: n = 175, mean fitness 0.189, edf 1.0, 0 interior peaks, highest fitness at the edge of the data
