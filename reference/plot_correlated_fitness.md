# Plot Correlated Fitness Surface

Plot Correlated Fitness Surface

## Usage

``` r
plot_correlated_fitness(
  tps,
  trait_cols,
  bins = 12,
  point_alpha = 0.7,
  show_points = FALSE,
  show_optimum = TRUE,
  show_groups = TRUE,
  group_lines = TRUE,
  uncertainty = c("none", "se", "band"),
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- tps:

  Output list from
  [`correlated_fitness_surface()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/Lande/reference/correlated_fitness_surface.md).

- trait_cols:

  Character vector of length 2 specifying the trait column names.

- bins:

  Integer specifying the number of contour bins. Default is 12.

- point_alpha:

  Numeric value for point transparency. Default is 0.7.

- show_points:

  Logical indicating whether to show original data points. Default is
  `FALSE`.

- show_optimum:

  Logical; mark the highest kept cell, a gold diamond, or an open one
  when it is on the edge of the data. Default is `TRUE`.

- show_groups:

  Logical; when the surface was fitted with a `group`, draw each group's
  mean (open circle, labelled) and the highest point of the surface
  within that group's hull: a filled triangle when it is a peak of the
  surface, an open one when the surface keeps rising past the group's
  range or the edge of the data. Default is `TRUE`.

- group_lines:

  Logical; join each group's mean to its peak with a dashed line.
  Default is `TRUE`.

- uncertainty:

  What to draw of the surface's standard error, which a GAM surface
  carries: `"none"` (the default), `"se"` for dashed contour lines of
  the standard error of the fitted fitness over the surface, or `"band"`
  for three panels, the lower bound, the fit and the upper bound, on one
  fill scale.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [`ggplot2::labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html).

## Value

A `ggplot` object representing the correlated fitness surface.

## Examples

``` r
prep <- prepare_selection_data(bumpus, "survival", c("total_length", "weight"))
surf <- correlated_fitness_surface(prep, "survival", c("total_length", "weight"), grid_n = 30)
#> IMPORTANT: Traits should already be standardized (mean = 0, SD = 1).
#>            Do NOT apply scale() again within this function.
#> Data type: binary; method: gam; n = 136; k = 29
#> GAM fitting with 136 observations
#>   Trying formula: main
#> Success with formula: main
#> Predictions range: 0.0472 to 0.703
#> Masked 424 of 900 grid points outside the data
plot_correlated_fitness(surf, c("total_length", "weight"), show_points = TRUE)
