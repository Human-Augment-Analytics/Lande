# Canonical analysis of the gamma matrix

Rotates the matrix of quadratic and correlational selection gradients to
its canonical axes (Phillips and Arnold 1989; Blows and Brooks 2003).
Each axis is a combination of the traits with a single curvature, its
eigenvalue: negative for stabilising and positive for disruptive
selection along that axis. Correlational selection that is spread over
many \\\gamma\_{ij}\\ shows up as curvature on a few axes.

## Usage

``` r
canonical_analysis(
  data,
  fitness_col,
  trait_cols,
  fitness_type = c("auto", "binary", "count", "continuous"),
  standardize = TRUE,
  group = NULL,
  bootstrap = FALSE,
  n_boot = 200,
  conf = 0.95,
  test = c("permutation", "double_regression"),
  n_perm = 999
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame containing fitness and trait measurements.

- fitness_col:

  A string specifying the name of the fitness column.

- trait_cols:

  A character vector of trait column names.

- fitness_type:

  A string indicating the fitness type: `"auto"`, `"binary"`, `"count"`,
  or `"continuous"`. Binary and count fitness take their p-values from a
  GLM (logistic, or Poisson and negative binomial) on the raw values;
  the gradients always come from OLS on relative fitness.

- standardize:

  Logical indicating whether to standardize traits to mean 0 and SD 1.
  Default is `TRUE`.

- group:

  Optional string specifying a grouping variable (e.g., "year", "site").
  Traits and relative fitness are standardised within each group, and
  for binary and count fitness the GLM that supplies the p-values gets a
  separate intercept for each group.

- bootstrap:

  Logical; add percentile intervals for the eigenvalues by resampling
  individuals, within groups when `group` is given. Default is `FALSE`.

- n_boot:

  Number of bootstrap resamples. Default is 200.

- conf:

  Confidence level of the bootstrap interval. Default is 0.95.

- test:

  Where the p-values come from: `"permutation"` (the default), Reynolds
  et al.'s (2010) permutation test, or `"double_regression"`, the
  double-regression tests, which are far too liberal.

- n_perm:

  Number of permutations. Default is 999.

## Value

An object of class `"canonical_analysis"`: `gamma`, the gamma matrix;
`beta`; `M`, the loadings with one column per axis; `axes`, a data frame
with `lambda`, its standard error and p-value, `theta`, and with the
bootstrap `CI_lower`, `CI_upper` and `N_Boot`; `scores`, the prepared
data with the canonical scores `m1`, `m2`, ... added; the fitness type,
`n`, `test` and `n_perm`.

## Details

The gamma matrix \\\gamma\\ comes from
[`selection_coefficients()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/lande/reference/selection_coefficients.md),
with the quadratic gradients doubled and the correlational gradients as
they stand. Its eigenvectors are the columns of `M` and its eigenvalues
the curvatures \\\lambda\\; directional selection along the axes is
\\\theta = M^T \beta\\. Standard errors come from the double regression
of Bisgaard and Ankenman (1996): fitness is refitted on the canonical
scores and their squares, without cross-products, and twice the
coefficient of a squared score is that axis's \\\lambda\\.

The double-regression tests treat the axes as known when they were
estimated from the same data. With 136 individuals and fitness unrelated
to five traits, the largest eigenvalue came out significant in about
three samples in four, so by default the p-values come from the
permutation test of Reynolds et al. (2010): fitness is shuffled among
individuals, within groups when `group` is given, the canonical analysis
and the double regression are repeated, and each axis's p-value is the
share of shuffles, counting the data as one, whose F for the eigenvalue
of the same rank is at least the observed one. It tests whether an axis
curves more than it would with fitness unrelated to the traits; once one
axis is strongly curved, the tests of the others are only rough. Every
fitness type uses least squares on relative fitness, and the result
depends on the random seed; call
[`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) first. With
`test = "double_regression"` the p-values come from the double
regression itself, for survival and counts from the logistic or count
model on the same terms. The standard errors treat the axes as known
either way.

Sampling error in \\\gamma\\ also spreads its eigenvalues, so the
largest curvatures are overestimated, especially with many traits and
few individuals (Reynolds et al. 2010), and the estimated axes lean
towards directions of phenotype with little variance (Morrissey 2014).
Read the eigenvalues together with the fitness surface along the same
axes, which
[`plot_canonical_axes()`](https://human-augment-analytics.github.io/lande/reference/plot_canonical_axes.md)
draws, and with the bootstrap intervals. With the bootstrap, each
resample's axes are matched to the original ones by their largest
absolute cosine, since order and sign change between resamples.
