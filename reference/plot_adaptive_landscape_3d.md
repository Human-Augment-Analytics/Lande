# Plot Adaptive Landscape (3D Perspective)

Plot Adaptive Landscape (3D Perspective)

## Usage

``` r
plot_adaptive_landscape_3d(
  landscape,
  trait_cols,
  theta = -30,
  phi = 30,
  grid_n = 200,
  color_palette = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- landscape:

  Output object of class `"adaptive_landscape"`.

- trait_cols:

  Character vector of length 2 specifying the trait column names.

- theta:

  Numeric azimuthal viewing angle. Default is -30.

- phi:

  Numeric colatitude viewing angle. Default is 30.

- grid_n:

  Ignored; the landscape's own grid is used.

- color_palette:

  Optional vector of colors for the surface. Defaults to viridis plasma.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [`fields::drape.plot()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/fields/man/drape.plot.html).

## Value

A 3D plot produced by
[`fields::drape.plot()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/fields/man/drape.plot.html).

## Examples

``` r
if (requireNamespace("fields", quietly = TRUE)) {
  prep <- prepare_selection_data(bumpus, "survival", c("total_length", "weight"))
  surf <- correlated_fitness_surface(prep, "survival", c("total_length", "weight"), grid_n = 30)
  land <- adaptive_landscape(prep, surf$model, c("total_length", "weight"),
                             simulation_n = 100, grid_n = 15)
  plot_adaptive_landscape_3d(land, c("total_length", "weight"))

#> 7   -0.4336396 -3.121579
#> Mean fitness at optimum: 0.6821
#> The highest mean fitness is on the edge of the grid; the landscape may keep rising beyond it
#> 75% of simulated individuals fell outside the data (99% at the optimum)
#> The optimum rests on extrapolation: more than 25% of the population simulated there lies outside the data
