# Medium ground finch survival from year to year

Medium ground finches (*Geospiza fortis*) marked and recaptured at El
Garrapatero, Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos. Each row is a bird in a year
it was seen, from 2004 to 2010, with whether it was seen again the next
year. Built by `data-raw/finch_yearly.R`.

## Usage

``` r
finch_yearly
```

## Format

A data frame with 1087 rows and 7 variables:

- band:

  Band code of the bird.

- year:

  Year the bird was seen.

- survived:

  `1` if the bird was seen again the next year, `0` otherwise.

- beak_pc1:

  Beak size: the first principal component of the three beak
  measurements over all the birds, signed so that larger beaks score
  higher.

- beak_length:

  Median beak length (mm).

- beak_width:

  Median beak width (mm).

- beak_depth:

  Median beak depth (mm).
