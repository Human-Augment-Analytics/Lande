# Plot Adaptive Landscape

Two traits give a contour map of mean fitness against the two population
means. One trait gives a curve of mean fitness against the population
mean, with the individual fitness function drawn alongside it for
comparison.

## Usage

``` r
plot_adaptive_landscape(
  landscape,
  trait_cols,
  original_data = NULL,
  group_col = NULL,
  bins = 12,
  show_optimum = TRUE,
  show_actual_means = TRUE,
  show_individual = TRUE,
  point_alpha = 0.8,
  show_support = FALSE,
  support_level = 0.5,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- landscape:

  Output object of class `"adaptive_landscape"`.

- trait_cols:

  One or two trait column names, matching the landscape.

- original_data:

  Optional data frame of original data points. Default is `NULL`.

- group_col:

  Optional character string specifying a grouping variable for labels.

- bins:

  Integer specifying the number of contour bins. Default is 12.

- show_optimum:

  Logical indicating whether to display the optimum point. Default is
  `TRUE`.

- show_actual_means:

  Logical indicating whether to display actual population means. Default
  is `TRUE`.

- show_individual:

  Logical; for a single trait, also draw the individual fitness function
  (dashed). Default is `TRUE`.

- point_alpha:

  Numeric value for point transparency. Default is 0.8.

- show_support:

  Logical; mark where the simulation leaves the data: a dashed line at
  `support_level` and a white overlay on the population means beyond it,
  where more than that share of the simulated population falls outside
  the observed traits. Default is `FALSE`.

- support_level:

  Share of the simulated population outside the data at which
  `show_support` draws its line. Default is 0.5.

  [`ggplot2::labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html).

## Value

A `ggplot` object representing the adaptive landscape.

## Examples

``` r
prep <- prepare_selection_data(bumpus, "survival", c("total_length", "weight"))
surf <- correlated_fitness_surface(prep, "survival", c("total_length", "weight"), grid_n = 30)
#> IMPORTANT: Traits should already be standardized (mean = 0, SD = 1).
#>            Do NOT apply scale() again within this function.
#> Data type: binary; method: gam; n = 136; k = 29
#> GAM fitting with 136 observations
#>   Trying formula: main
#> Success with formula: main
#> Predictions range: 0.0472 to 0.703
#> Masked 424 of 900 grid points outside the data
land <- adaptive_landscape(prep, surf$model, c("total_length", "weight"),
                           simulation_n = 100, grid_n = 15)
#> IMPORTANT: Traits should already be standardized (mean = 0, SD = 1).
#>            Use prepare_selection_data() before calling this function.
#>            Do NOT standardize again within this function.
#> Population mean grid ranges:
#>   total_length: -2.96 to 2.94
#>   weight: -3.12 to 4.85
#> Estimated within-population variance-covariance:
#>              total_length weight
#> total_length       1.0000 0.5839
#> weight             0.5839 1.0000
#> Calculating mean fitness for 225 grid points
#> Optimal population mean phenotype:
#>   total_length    weight
#> 7   -0.4336396 -3.121579
#> Mean fitness at optimum: 0.6739
#> 76% of simulated individuals fell outside the data (97% at the optimum)
#> The optimum rests on extrapolation: more than 25% of the population simulated there lies outside the data
